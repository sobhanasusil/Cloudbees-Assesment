# GitHub Users API Assessment

This project is a simple web application built with React that utilizes the GitHub Users API to fetch and display information about GitHub users. It utilizes Material-UI (MUI) components for the user interface. It consists of two pages:

## User List Page
This is the default screen of the application. It fetches users from the GitHub API and displays them in a list using Material-UI components. Each item in the list shows the user's avatar, first name, last name, and username. Clicking on any user in the list will navigate to the User Details page.

## User Details Page
This page displays more detailed information for the selected user. It shows extended profile information such as company and social handles, along with a summary of their followers, following, and number of public repositories.
